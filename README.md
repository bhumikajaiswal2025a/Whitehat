##CYBERSECURITY NEWS
well, i havent really heard bout many cybersecurity news recently but heres two things i recently came across
I recently read about a major data breach where attackers exploited a vulnerability in a web application due to poor input validation, leading to user data exposure. This incident highlighted the importance of secure coding practices and regular security testing.
I was reading about kevin mitnick recently who is a convicted hacker who has comitted multiple felony in the feild of cybersecurity and hacking sites and copying company data.
